# WeRateDogs-Udacity-Project
In this project, we wrangled, analysed and visualised the dataset of the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

First of all, 3 datasets have been gathered to perform a better analysis, The WeRateDogs Twitter archive, The tweet image predictions and Additional data
from the Twitter API.
For the assessment part, the two types have been required. For visual assessment, I used Sublime and Google Sheets, along with the non directed visuel 
assessment through juputer notebook to detect pertinent issues. For programmatic assessment, I used pandas Methods and functions to perform directed 
and non directed methods assessment. I detected 8 quality issues and two tidinrss issues.
For the cleaning part, I used the define, code, and test steps of the cleaning process. I utilized the most common cleaning functions and methods
in the pandas library to clean the eight quality issues and two tidiness issues identified in the previous step Assessing Data.
After the gatherin, assessing and cleaning processes, I had a tidy and high quality data.\

Then, I performed the analysis and the visualization and generated a few insights.
